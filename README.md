# Next.js Link Component Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Next.js's Link component where links appear to render correctly but fail to navigate to the intended pages.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component with two links.  These links should navigate to `/` and `/about`, respectively, but they do not.  This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as incorrect routing configuration, missing pages, or client-side routing issues.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution.  The solution might involve verifying the existence of the target pages, ensuring that routing configuration is correct and the pages are exported correctly,  or checking for conflicts with other libraries or custom routing solutions.
